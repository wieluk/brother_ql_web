This is a dockerized `python3` web service to print labels on Brother QL label printers.
The web interface is [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). The CI tests are run using `pytest` in the [latest version of Python](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/python/3-alpine) for Alpine Linux.

There are a lot of forks of the `brother_ql` and `brother_ql_web` repos from [`pklaus/brother_ql`](https://github.com/pklaus/brother_ql).
This fork tries to support many more printers and provide additional features.

Additional printer support comes from [`matmair/brother_ql-inventree`](https://github.com/matmair/brother_ql-inventree) as a dependency for communicating with the printers and [`tbnobody/brother_ql_web`](https://github.com/tbnobody/brother_ql_web) as a base for the frontend as there have been a few fixes and improvements implemented over there. This fork also builds on enhancements from [`dersimn/brother_ql_web`](https://github.com/dersimn/brother_ql_web) and [`davidramiro/brother_ql_web`](https://github.com/davidramiro/brother_ql_web) for which we are grateful, too.

### Supported templates

- `{{counter[:<start>]}}` — Inserts the current counter value (automatically increments when printing multiple labels at the same time).
- `{{datetime:<format>}}` — Inserts the current date and time, e.g. `%H:%M:%S %d.%m.%Y` (see [strftime](https://strftime.org/)).
- `{{uuid}}` — Inserts a random UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
- `{{short-uuid}}` — Inserts a shortened version of a UUID.
- `{{env:<var>}}` — Inserts the value of the environment variable `<var>`.
- `{{random[:<len>][:shift]}}` — Inserts a random string of optional length `<len>` (defaulting to 64). The optional `shift` parameter can be used to shift the random string around to fill gaps.

## Docker Compose

You may also use the example [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file provided in this repository to quickly get started with Docker Compose:

``` yaml
services:
  brother_ql_web:
    image: ghcr.io/dl6er/brother-ql-web:latest
    # build: . # you may also build the container locally
    container_name: brother_ql_web
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8013:8013"
    devices:
      - "/dev/usb/lp0:/dev/usb/lp0"
    volumes:
      - ./labels:/app/labels
    environment:
      - LABEL_DEFAULT_SIZE=62
      - LABEL_DEFAULT_ORIENTATION=standard
      - PRINTER_MODEL=QL-800
      - PRINTER_PRINTER=file:///dev/usb/lp0
```

Or, if you want to use automatic printer detection:

``` yaml
services:
  brother_ql_web:
    image: ghcr.io/dl6er/brother-ql-web:latest
    # build: . # you may also build the container locally
    container_name: brother_ql_web
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8013:8013"
    privileged: true
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - /dev/usb:/dev/usb
      - ./labels:/app/labels
    environment:
      - LABEL_DEFAULT_SIZE=62
      - LABEL_DEFAULT_ORIENTATION=standard
      - PRINTER_MODEL=QL-800
```

The container will automatically show printers when they become available.

To build the image locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DL6ER/brother_ql_web.git
cd brother_ql_web
docker compose build
```

### Usage

Once it's running, access the web interface by opening the page with your browser.
If you run it on your local machine, go to <http://localhost:8013>.
You will then be forwarded by default to the interactive web gui located at `/labeldesigner`.

All in all, the web server offers:

-   a web GUI allowing you to print your labels, and
-   an API.

### Network printer support

Network printers are supported but with some limitations regarding automatic detection and status queries. The printer status is always shown as "Network Printer" for network printers as they do not support the usual USB-based status queries. Automatic detection of network printers is done by scanning the ARP table for devices with known Brother MAC address prefixes, which may not be exhaustive. If you have a Brother network printer that is not detected automatically, you can still add it manually by specifying its IP address in the printer configuration (e.g., `tcp://<IP_ADDRESS>`). Please also open an issue if you have a Brother network printer that is not detected automatically so that we can integrate detection for this model.

### API

All functionality of the web interface is also available via a REST API. Currently, the API is not documented in a separate documentation but can be explored using the web interface when the container is running.

### Contributing / Development

To contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a [fork in your own namespace](https://github.com/DL6ER/brother_ql_web/fork)

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your name goes here>/brother_ql_web.git
   cd brother_ql_web
   ```

2. Make your changes and test them locally, preferably inside the convenient devcontainer.

3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

This project offers a **Development Container** for easy local development. You can right away start coding without worrying about the environment setup using the free and open source IDE [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Other editors may be able to utilize the provided Dockerfile for a similar setup. Note that the provided devcontainer does not mount any possibly existing local USB printers for compatibility reasons. You may want to edit `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to mount such local devices.
